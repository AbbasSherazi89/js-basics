# Conditional (Ternary) Operator
` variablename = (condition) ? value1:value2 `
For example:
let voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough";

- The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
- for - loops through a block of code a number of times
- for/in - loops through the properties of an object
- for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- The break statement "jumps out" of a loop.
- The continue statement "jumps over" one iteration in the loop.
The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.


# JavaScript Iterables
- Iterables are iterable objects (like Arrays).
- Iterables can be iterated over with for..of loops

# Iterating
- Iterating is easy to understand.
- It simply means looping over a sequence of elements.
- Here are some easy examples:
    * Iterating over a String
    * Iterating over an Array

# JavaScript Sets
- A JavaScript Set is a collection of unique values.
Each value can only occur once in a Set.

* How to Create a Set
You can create a JavaScript Set by:

Passing an Array to new Set()
Create a new Set and use add() to add values
Create a new Set and use add() to add variables

# JavaScript Maps
- A Map holds key-value pairs where the keys can be any datatype.
- A Map remembers the original insertion order of the keys.

    * How to Create a Map
You can create a JavaScript Map by:

Passing an Array to new Map()
Create a Map and use Map.set()

# The constructor Property

- The constructor property returns the constructor function for all JavaScript variables.

# The instanceof Operator
The instanceof operator returns true if an object is an instance of the specified object:
(cars instanceof Array); // true
(cars instanceof Object); //true
(cars instanceof String); //false
(cars instanceof Number); //false

# The void Operator
The void operator evaluates an expression and returns undefined.
